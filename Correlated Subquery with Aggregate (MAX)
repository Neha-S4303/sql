This is an example of a correlated subquery used to filter rows by an aggregate (MAX).

# Using the table playground.revenue, write a SQL query to select rows from a given table that have the maximum revenue value for each id.
 The resultant table should have three columns - "id", "rev", "content". 
 Additionally, the results should be ordered in descending order by revenue.


SELECT id, rev, content
  FROM playground.revenue r1
  WHERE rev = (SELECT max(rev)
  FROM playground.revenue r2
  WHERE r1.id=r2.id)
  ORDER BY rev desc
